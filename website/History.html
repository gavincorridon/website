			<h1>1970</h1>
			<p>In 1970, the german government came out with its first privacy laws due to the newer computers coming out and sweden also managed to come out with new laws that helped<br>
			to stop data theft. After these two new reforms were enacted other web standards came out that required things like consent to gain access to personal records and defined the<br>
			rights of the people on the internet.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>1983</h1>
			<p>In 1983, the idea of wether or not you had to the right self-determination of your data on the internet was discussed in a huge case over ther national census survey in germany.<br>
			It was ruled that we as the people should have complete control over  who has our data and how it is stored. In my opinion, this was a crucial time because it showed that not even the<br>
			government can take our data without our permission.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>1995</h1>
			<p>1995 is when the european union came into play. They wanted to basically add more standards so that governments could not move data without the permission of the people in an unsafe way.<br>
			They enacted standards that allowed for the people of europe to have full rights of access to the data which then spread to other countries. There was some discrepacny in that some other<br>
			countries did not have as strong laws about data privacy.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>2000</h1>
			<p>This is when the safe harbor arrangement came out.These where rules between the us and europe that basically told them how data could be trasnfered safely and ethically which would then <br>
			lead to what we know today as the EU-US privacy sheild.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>2009</h1>
			<p>The Personal data privacy and security act of 2009 was made so that there was uniform protection between the states due to each state having their own versions of data privacy laws.<br>
			The idea behind this was that they wanted rules that where centered around protecting personal data at large. So, the government tried to pass a bill that would increase how protected <br>
			the data of people is in companies and agencies</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>2016-2022</h1>
			<p>Now we are seeing much more precise laws in regards to data privacy. We are seeing arrests and fines for people who try to threaten the personal data of people. The general data <br>
			protection regualtion is helping us to define better standards for what comapnies are allowed to do with your data and what they are nto allowed to do. In todays society we see huge comapnies like facebook<br>
			getting fined billions of dollars for illegaly using the information of its users.</p>
