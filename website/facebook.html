					<h1>Facebook Scandal</h1>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<p>The facebook scandal was a data privacy related problem that took place in 2010.  Facebook basically took your information without you allowing it and sent it to companies that would
					then turn out to use it for political advertising. Facebook and cambridge analytical made an app that would basically ask you a bunch of questions. Once you were done answering the questions,
					the app would create a profile for you that companies could then use to politicaly advertise to you. The scandal ended up affecting around 88 million people and in my opnion shows that these big
					companies that are to big to fail, take advantage of the lack luster data privacy laws in order to benift them.<p>
