					<h2>The Solution</h2>
					<br>
					<p>As a result of the case, facebook was fined a ton of money. New privacy laws where also put into place that would prevent facebook and other companies from ever using your information
					without your consent. The problem with this, and why i think it is so important to even the general internet user, is that companies always find a way around these laws. As a solution i feel 
					that we need to involve
					the everyday people more in these data privacy laws. How would you feel if you knew people where taking your personal info about you and your family? If we truly want internet reform to protect our 
					data, we need to work towards
					a more structred data system and crack down on these companies who are taking advantage of us. Facebook was a huge step in the right direction but we need to go further in order to ensure that our data is 
					properly protected.</p>
