					<h2>Past Impact</h2>
					<br>
					<p>In the past data, privacy was not so popular. Due to the less sophisticated technology, data privacy laws werent as needed.
					The problem came to be that because technology is one of the fastest growing industries, the laws that where made could not keep up with emmerging technologies. As a result, 
					we saw alot of comapnies taking advantge of certain aspects of peoples data like facebook. Facebook would secretly collect info of users and sell it to third party companies for a profit.
					If we had stricter laws in the past, this as a whole could of been prevented. I will go more into the facebook scandal on the upcoming page.</p>

					<h2>Current Impact</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Now a days, people are using the internet more than ever. Ecommerce is growing at rapid rates and at an all time high. Companies everyday are requiring more information
					from people because of the increased use of the internet. Companies look at the internet as a way to advertise to get more consumers to there products. The problem with 
					this is that companies need ways to find out who to advertise to on the internet and how they should. Sadly, some companies trun to buying YOUR data from companies that you
					use all the time. This has a huge imapct on the privacy of our info and should be addressed immediatly with internet reform.</p>

					<h2>Future Impact</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Do you ever wonder why you look at something online and later that day get advertisments for it? This is because the companies that we are using are secretly selling our information
					to companies who then use it to target you. In a world where data privacy laws where more strict and structured, we would not have to worry about using webistes and apps in fear of our information
					being secretly sold and used to amrket to us. In a future with more internet reform, these big companies like facebook would not even get the chance to illegaly send YOUR personal information 
					to other companies. We as consumers would have our right to privacy.</p>
